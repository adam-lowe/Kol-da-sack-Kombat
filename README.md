## Synopsis
We are a group of avid gamers that wanted to create something we are passionate about for our project. We wanted to be ambitious with our project to push ourselves to create more then we otherwise thought possible we could. It was a struggle to get it done in the short time frame, but there is something that we are all proud of with this game and with a little extra tender loving we could have something that is really joyous and addictive to play.

## Getting Started
To get started once you load the webpage you will first enjoy the background story that will be displayed before you. There will be an option for a 'New Game' or a 'Load Game'. If you have not previously played the game before click on 'New Game' to create your profile with a class you can choose from. Once you create your profile login with the same information and it will bring you to the game screen!

## Rules
### It's Battle TIME!!! KOL-DA-SACK KOMBAT!!
There are 4 options for the user to choose from. 
- Attack: Is a guaranteed hit on the enemy with a random damage amount based on the classes minDamage and maxDamage
- Special: Is a 50% chance of a hit on the enemy with a random damage amount based on the classes minDamage and maxDamage which is then DOUBLED!!
- Potion: The user can heal for between 15 and 30 HP, but the user can only use a potion 3 times, so use them wisely!!
- Dodge: This is a guaranteed miss for the enemy so well timed dodges can absorb a CRIT from the enemy and bring you one step closer to VICTORY!!

LAST ONE ALIVE WINS!!!

## Difficulties
We originally sought out to create a user on user game, but soon realized under the time crunch it would of taken to much effort just to get that aspect working that the game itself would of lacked. We then wanted to try to create a global stats tracking so people can see how many times all users have won or lost against the enemy.

## For the Future
We plan on making a global stats section so users can see how others are doing and have a sense of accomplishment when they can see that their stats are being stored and they are contributing!!
